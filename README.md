## Assignment Guidelines

### Assignment Structure
Each assignment directory contains:
- **Source files** (`.tex`, `.R`, `.py`, etc.)
- **Output files** (`.pdf`, figures, results)
- **Data** (if applicable)
- **README** (specific instructions or notes)

### LaTeX Workflow
For assignments requiring LaTeX reports:
1. Use the templates provided in `Resources/Templates/`
2. Compile using VSCode with LaTeX Workshop extension
3. Include all figures and references
4. Export final PDF to assignment directory

## Technologies Used

- **LaTeX** for report writing and documentation
- **R/Python** for statistical analysis and computing
- **Git** for version control
- **VSCode** as primary development environment

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
